# Storyline

## Background
Phloem feeding insects, such as the whitefly *Bemisia tabaci*, are a major pests in agriculture and cause massive yield losses. Due to their stealthy feeding style, they penetrate the phloem with their stylet without causing cell damage. This allows them to bypass most of the plants defence mechanisms. Although food quality plays an important role in animal development, research on whitefly resistance in tomato has mainly focused on the trichomes instead of the phloem they feed from. 

## Unknown
The underlying mechanism of resistance based on reduced whitefly nymphal development, observed in *Solanum chmielewskii*. 

## Result statement
Here we make a case that the presence of a vasculature-based factor in the wild tomato accession *Solanum chmielewskii* LA1840 causes *Bemisia tabaci* nymphs feeding from this host to display hampered development compared to their performance on *Solanum lycopersicum* cv Moneymaker.

## Implications
This work highlights the importance of phloem composition in the plant-phloem feeder interactions which could be applied in breeding for phloem feeder resistance in tomato, and other crops.
