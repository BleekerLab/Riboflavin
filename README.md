# Riboflavin

storyline

Background
Phloem feeding insects, such as the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, are a major pests in agriculture and cause massive yield losses. The two most promising options for defence against phloem feeders are on the outside of a plant (i.e. trichomes), where the insect can be killed or repelled prior to feeding.  Due to their stealthy feeding style, they penetrate the phloem with their stylet without causing cell damage. This allows them to bypass most of the plants defence mechanisms. Although food quality plays an important role in animal development, research on whitefly resistance in tomato has mainly focused on the trichomes instead of the phloem they feed from. In this paper we focused on developmental effects of whitefly established on its host, tomato, already.

Unknown
The underlying mechanism of resistance based on reduced whitefly nymphal development, observed in Solanum chmielewskii 

Findings
-	We identified an accession of Solanum chmielewskii on which whitefly nymphs do not develop
-	The resistance phenotype was studied in detail: no development beyond stage ? 
-	Screening of an introgression library points at resistance residing on chromosome 1. 
-	Metabolomics approach comparing IL1927 and ILcontrol indicated the presence of elevated (?) levels of the metabolite riboflavin in the resistant line. 
-	Because WF carefully feed on the phloem, we set out to identify the presence of this compound in the phloem.
-	PoC: feeding of ribovlavin to the vasculature resulted in reproduction of the WF phenotype


Result statement
Here we make a case that the presence of the phloem-based metabolite riboflavin in the wild tomato accession Solanum chmielewskii causes Bemisia tabaci nymphs feeding from this host to display hampered development compared to their performance on Solanum lycopersicum cv Moneymaker.

Implications
This work highlights the importance of phloem composition in the plant-phloem feeder interactions which could be applied in breeding for phloem feeder resistance in tomato, and other crops.
