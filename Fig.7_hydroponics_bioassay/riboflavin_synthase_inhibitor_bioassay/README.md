# Bioassay on _S. chmielewskii_ treated with a riboflavin synthase inhibitor


## Background info
MM and _S. chmielewskii_ cuttings are grown on hydroponics solution with or without inhibitor. Does the resistance phenotype disappear after inhibition of riboflavin?




# MRAN checkpoint data
__December 1, 2020__ is set as the checkpoint for all R packages available from the CRAN.

If required, change it everywhere in the scripts (`grep -r "checkpoint"`) and 
it will search through all directories and files for the `checkpoint` function. 

```{r}
library("checkpoint")
checkpoint("2020-12-01")
```
