## Riboflavin feeding assay description

From the metabolite data of the introgression lines, Arjen found riboflavin as candidate metabolite.   

In 2016, Paula did a bioassay on cultivar KG1955 grown in hydroponics with or without riboflavin added to the solution. The plants did not handle the riboflavin treatment very well, 6 of the 12 plants died. Of the control treatment, only 1 of the 12 died.
In the word document is Paula's explanation of the experimental set-up, in case anything is unclear.

Because the eggs and small nymphs (instar 1-3) can be difficult to count, Paula does not trust the first part of the data (until the first 4th instars emerge).
She's afraid she might have missed some. Therefore she only took a ratio between the number of 4th instars per total number of nymphs on the last day for the graph & statistics.
If you only do this for the last day of the experiment, you see a lower 4th instar/total nymphs ratio on riboflavin treated plants

As Paula tried her best for both treatments to count all eggs and nymphs (and I believe she's really careful and precise with experiments), 
I don't really think it matters if there were a few miscounts. This will probably be aproxamatly the same for the two treatments.
Therefore I think I could take the number of eggs to calculate the emergence and survival rate. 
I know you don't like using ratio's for statistics, but Yu-Hsien told me this is the most fair way to show insect developmental data. 
He also said that using the total number of nymphs on the last day for a ratio is deffinetly not oke.

I tried making line graphs for absolute number of eggs or nymphs over time and for the ratio of (4th instar) nymphs per eggs over time, 
and I don't find anything that points towards resistance on riboflavin fed plants.

The [Excel file](./2016-10-17-11-03_Riboflavin_20mg_end.xlsx) is the original dataset, the [`.csv` file](./data/csv) is were I tried to order the data a bit.

## Update 04 March 2021
Petra and I had a meeting this morning in which we discussed these results. She understands why I don't see any evidence for resistance for riboflavin in this data. 
Riboflavin might still play a role in the resistance, but only in combination with other things (genes, enzymes, metabolites, physiological aspects) in LA1840 (chmielewskii).
We still need to come up with a good experiment for this hypothesis.
Petra came up with the idea to redo this experiment, but also use the resistant introgression line on hydroponics.
Or better would be to use a LA1840 knock-out line of a riboflavin synthase, but this is probably really difficult/impossible.

## Riboflavin experimental protocol

What you need to know beforehand.  
I used for my experiment a final concentration of 20 mg/L riboflavin. I started with 5mg/L and gradualy increased it (see protocol) till it was 20 mg/L. If you go too quick the plants will start to turn yellow or get lesions.

Ribfolavin in 5 mM KOH solution is yellow, when you add it to the hydroponics solution it will turn orange.

I always used plants from seeds but you can also use cuttings. 

I have added the dates and days that I increased the riboflavin so if you have a question I can look it up easier.


Riboflavine protocol nymphs

Riboflavine stock
100 mg roboflavine in 1 ml 5mM KOH, and shake (solution will turn yellow0
Control solution
5 mM KOH

1. 1955 seeds were germinated either on soil or between 2 wet paper tissues.  
2. After 5 to 7 days the stem of the seedlings were wrapped into cotton and transferred to the hydroponics system (0,5 ml of each solution per 1 L water).   
3.Hydroponics solutions was changed 3x a week.  
4. when plants are taller than 15 cm, I used 1ml of each hydroponics solution to 1 L water
(what I did is 2.5-5 ml of each solution in a 50 ml tube and add this to 5 liters of water. There is a 5 L container in the greenhouse).  
5. After 4 weeks of being on hydroponics riboflavine was added 5 mg per 1l (50 microL) and 50 WF females ( wednesday 12/10/2016).
6. Two days after I removed the WFs and refreshed the hydroponics solution with 10 mg/L riboflavin (Friday 14/10/2016).
7. Three days later after changing to 10 mg/L I refreshed the hydroponics and added 15 mg/l riboflavin (Monday 17/10/2016)
8. Two days later after changing to 15 mg/L I refreshed the hydroponics and added 20 mg/L riboflavin (Wednesday 19/10/2016) and counted the nymphs.
9. on 21/10/2016 I had crawlers, on 24/10/2016 2nd instar, on 26/10/2016 3rd instar, on 28/10/2016 3rd instar, on 31/10/2016to 04-11-2016 pulpa and adults.
