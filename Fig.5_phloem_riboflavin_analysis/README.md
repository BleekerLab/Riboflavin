# Targeted analysis of riboflavin in the phloem


## Background info
Can we find riboflavin in the phloem? What is the difference between S. chmielewskii and MM? Possibly the riboflavin is glycosylated for solubility in the phloem.




# MRAN checkpoint data
__December 1, 2020__ is set as the checkpoint for all R packages available from the CRAN.

If required, change it everywhere in the scripts (`grep -r "checkpoint"`) and 
it will search through all directories and files for the `checkpoint` function. 

```{r}
library("checkpoint")
checkpoint("2020-12-01")
